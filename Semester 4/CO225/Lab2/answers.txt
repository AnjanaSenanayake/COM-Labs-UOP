1)N comparisons

2)After removing the first item from the array,we have to copy rest the to front and make the last element a null, thus the number of operations will depend on the number elements in the array.

3)Yes. because we can speed up the process of searching an element in an array by implementing 'binary search' algorithm.But to do this array should be sorted.  

4)Option 1 is more efficient, since it has only one comparison with respect to the option 2.

5)Yes. -Xlint warnings can be suppressed with java annotations.
