2) No. There can not be any differences since these
data are not requested individually by client, but sent from the
server. so whoever the client is he/she should recieve 
the same data.

3) Stock prices come along with a tag called "data". otherwise 
its the same.

4) The wait() method is called Until the stock price is updated, 
otherwise the same stock value will be printed over again and 
again.

When wait() method is called the current thread will be put to the
waiting stack. Thereafter we can wake up the previous thread by
calling the notifyAll() method, once the price is updated.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that we need to call
wait() and notifyAll() methods always inside a synchronized block
to avoid clashes between threads which might lead to racing 
conditions.
