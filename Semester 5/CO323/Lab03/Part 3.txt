To reduce the congestion, the bucket is programmed to 
reduce its capacity by 20%, if it started to flow high 
density packets(packets within the size of 80% of bucket
capacity) simultaneously(for 3 consecutive packets), assuming 
the situation as a beginning of a bursty packet flow. 

Again bucket capacity will set to default once the bursty 
period is over. Thus, this method will able to forsee and 
reduce overcoming congestions.

This method is coded in the same program code.
